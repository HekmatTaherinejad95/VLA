# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Model

A PyTorch implementation of a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that combines computer vision and natural language processing to generate actions based on visual observations and text instructions.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a multimodal neural network that can:
- Process visual input (images) through a convolutional neural network
- Understand natural language instructions through word embeddings
- Fuse visual and linguistic information to generate appropriate actions
- Learn from training data to map vision-language pairs to actions

The VLA model is designed for applications where an agent needs to understand both what it sees (vision) and what it's told to do (language) to perform the correct action.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The VLA model consists of three main components:

1. **Vision Encoder**: A CNN that processes 64x64 RGB images
   - 2 convolutional layers with ReLU activation
   - Max pooling for dimensionality reduction
   - Outputs 256-dimensional feature vector

2. **Language Encoder**: Processes text instructions
   - Word embeddings for vocabulary representation
   - Linear layer to reduce to 256 dimensions
   - Averages word embeddings for sentence representation

3. **Fusion Network**: Combines vision and language features
   - Concatenates 256-dim vision + 256-dim language features
   - 2-layer MLP with ReLU activation
   - Outputs action probabilities (10 action classes)

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd VLA
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📊 Data Format

The training data should be in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
[
    {
        "image": "path/to/image1.png",
        "instruction": "pick up the red block"
    },
    {
        "image": "path/to/image2.png", 
        "instruction": "move the green cup to the left"
    }
]
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Training the Model

To train the VLA model on your data:

```bash
cd scripts
python train.py
```

The training script will:
- Load training data from `data/sample_data.json`
- Build vocabulary from instructions
- Initialize the VLA model
- Train for 5 epochs using cross-entropy loss
- Save the trained model to `models/trained_vla_model.pth`

### Running Inference

To run inference with a trained model:

```bash
cd scripts
python run.py
```

The inference script will:
- Load the trained model
- Process a sample instruction ("pick up the red block")
- Generate and execute the predicted action

### Custom Usage

You can also use the model programmatically:

```python
import torch
from models.vla_model import VLAModel

# Initialize model
model = VLAModel(vocab_size=100, action_dim=10)

# Load trained weights
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('models/trained_vla_model.pth'))
model.eval()

# Prepare input
image = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)  # Batch of 1, 3 channels, 64x64
instruction = torch.LongTensor([[0, 1, 2]])  # Tokenized instruction

# Get action
with torch.no_grad():
    action = model(image, instruction)
    predicted_action = action.argmax().item()
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Key parameters can be modified in the training script:

- `NUM_EPOCHS`: Number of training epochs (default: 5)
- `LEARNING_RATE`: Learning rate for Adam optimizer (default: 0.001)
- `DATA_PATH`: Path to training data JSON file
- `MODEL_SAVE_PATH`: Path to save trained model

## 🎮 Environment Integration

The project includes a `DummyEnv` class for testing purposes. In real applications, you would:

1. Replace `DummyEnv` with your actual environment
2. Implement proper observation and action spaces
3. Add reward signals for reinforcement learning
4. Handle environment reset and termination

## 📈 Model Performance

The current implementation is a proof-of-concept with:
- Random image generation for training
- Mock action labels
- Basic vocabulary building from training data

For production use, you would need:
- Real image data
- Expert demonstrations or reinforcement learning
- Proper evaluation metrics
- Hyperparameter tuning
